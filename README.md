# Command Master

Command Master is a Rust project designed to help users learn and explore Linux commands in a fun and interactive way. The program randomly selects a Linux command, provides a concise explanation of its usage, and suggests a small exercise to practice with it.

The project uses OpenAI's API to generate clear and tailored explanations for the selected commands. In future updates, the program will include a feature to save interesting commands and recall them periodically based on a priority system. A max heap is planned to efficiently manage saved commands by their priority.

<br/>

## Features

- __Random Linux__ Command Selection: A random command is selected and explained to the user.
- __AI-Generated Explanations__: OpenAI's API generates concise explanations and practical exercises for the command.
- __Planned Features__:
    - __Saving Commands with Priority__: Interesting commands will be saved and managed based on a priority system (1 to 7). Commands with higher priorities will be recalled more frequently.
    - __Max Heap for Priority Management__: A max heap data structure will likely be implemented to manage and efficiently retrieve commands with the highest priority.

<br/>

## Prerequisites

- __Rust__: Make sure you have Rust installed (stable version recommended).
- __OpenAI API Key__: An API key is required to use the AI generation features. Obtain your key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/settings).

<br/>

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/command-master.git
cd command-master
```
2. Configure your OpenAI API Key:
    - Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and add your API key:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```
3. Build the project:
```sh
cargo build
```
4. Run the project:
```sh
cargo run
```

<br/>

## Usage

1. The program will randomly select a Linux command.
2. It will display a concise explanation of the command, generated by OpenAI's API.
3. A small exercise will be suggested to help you practice the command.
4. In the future, commands marked as interesting will be saved and managed based on priority, using a max heap for efficient retrieval.

## Example Output

__Selected Command__: `ls`

```plaintext
Description:
  The `ls` command lists the files and directories in a folder.

Exercise:
  List all the files in a directory, including hidden ones, sorted by size in descending order.

Possible Solution:
  ls -laS
```

<br/>

## Future Features

- __Saving Commands__:
    - Add a feature to save interesting commands with a priority level (1 to 7) for periodic reminders.
    - Max Heap for Priority Management: A max heap will likely be used to prioritize saved commands, ensuring that higher-priority commands are retrieved and displayed first.
- __Export Functionality__:
    - Save interesting commands to a JSON or CSV file for external usage.
- __Command Scheduling__:
    - Automatic reminders for saved commands based on user-configured schedules.

<br/>

## Testing

The project includes tests to ensure the core functionalities work as expected. Run the tests using:

```sh
cargo test
```

<br/>

## Project Structure

- `src/main.rs`: The program's entry point.
- `src/ia/`: Module handling OpenAI API interactions.
    `chat.rs`: Manages requests and responses with OpenAI.
- __Future Modules__: Planned implementation for saving and recalling commands with priority (likely using a max heap).
